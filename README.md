# Updated Portfolio featuring an Owen Wilson "Wow Generator"

## Description
This is a simplified and enhanced portfolio website for myself which features a new projects page containing a random Owen Wilson "Wow Generator". When you click the Wow button, an API is called that serves a scene from a movie in which Owen Wilson says the word "Wow". It automatically updates to tell you the name of the character he is playing, and the movie he is starring in.
